[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Usage

- create a space with the "Gallery" space template on [Contentful][1]
- clone this repo and run `npm i`
- edit `deliveryAccessToken`, `spaceId` and `galleryTypeId` (id of the content type `Photo Gallery`) in `config.js` included in the project root
- run `npm start`
- open `localhost:9020/` to see it in action
